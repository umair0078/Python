# Python Introduction and Flow Control
This repository contains programs demonstrating basic concepts of Python and flow of control.

## Contents
- [Program 1](Dictionary.py): This program creates a dictionary called `d` and assigns it some key-value pairs.
It then prints the contents of the dictionary, using different methods to access the values.

- [Program 2](Grade_Calculation.py): This program takes the user's marks as input and then prints their grade.
The grade is determined using a series of if-elif statements.

- [Program 3](Concatination.py): This program first defines two strings, `a` and `b`, and then combines them with the string representation of the integer `c`.
It then prints the message and prompts the user to enter their name.

- [Program 4](data_types.py): I already know about python datatypes therefore I have just write some comments and did practice of complex datatype.

- [Program 5](dict_pr.py): This program first defines an empty dictionary called `fav_lang`.It then prompts the user to enter their favorite language and stores their input in the dictionary.

- [Program 6](for_loop.py): This program first defines a list called `numbers` that contains the numbers from 1 to 9.
It then prints the numbers in the list using three different for loops.The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 1 and ending at 9 (not including 10). The second for loop will print the numbers from from 1 to 20 and it will skip the two numbers and then prints the third number because range is "range(1,21,3).

- [Program 7](global keyword.py): The first line of the program defines a global variable called a and assigns it the value 10. The second line defines a function called my_func(). The function my_func() defines a local variable called a and assigns it the value 20. The function then prints the value of the local variable a.
The third line of the program calls the function my_func(). The fourth line defines a function called func_2(). The function func_2() uses the global keyword to access the global variable a and assigns it the value 50. The function then prints the value of the global variable a.The last line of the program prints the value of the global variable a.

- [Program 8](greatest_number.py): This program first takes the four numbers as an input from the user in integer form and then it first compares the first two numbers and the greater number is stored in f1 as a result, then it compares next two numbers and the result of greatest number will store in f2 as a result and then finally, it compares the f1 and f2 and we will get the greatest number.

- [Program 9](if_statement.py): The control will go inside the if statement only if the given condition is true otherwise it will print nothing.

- [Program 10](if_else_statement.py): The control will go go inside if statement if the given condition is true otherwise it will go inside the else block.

- [Program 11](practice_problem.py): This program first takes the name of the user as an input and I have created a list. Then I used the condition, if name is present in the list it will print "Your name is present in the list", otherwise it will print "Your name is not present in the list".
  
- [Program 12](practice_problem2.py): This program first takes the favourite fruit of the user as an input and I have created a list of fruits. Then I used the condition, if fruit entered by the user is present in the list it will print "Yes, it is present"", otherwise it will print "It is not present".

- [Program 11](practice_problem.py): This program first takes the name of the user as an input and then, I have created a list. Then I used the condition, if name is present in the list it will print "Your name is present in the list", otherwise it will print your name is not present in the list.
